# awesome-spatio-temporal-action-detection
A curated list of papers in the domain of spatio-temporal action detection (or action localization). Inspired by [awesome-self-supervised-learning](https://github.com/jason718/awesome-self-supervised-learning) and [awesome-semi-supervised-learning](https://github.com/yassouali/awesome-semi-supervised-learning#image-classification). NOTE: This repository does not contains papers for Temporal Action Localization.

## Background
Spatio-temporal action detection is localization of activities in spatial plus temporal dimension.
